## Discovering Apps

Deta Space comes with [Deta Discovery](/discovery) - Space’s app marketplace. On Discovery developers can publish their apps built with the Space developer platform for other users to find and install.

Deta Discovery consists of three sections, “Popular”, “Recent” and “Hot”. Depending on the selected section you will either see the most popular apps, the most recent apps or the hottest apps right now.

Clicking on an app’s icon opens its Discovery page which contains more information about the app itself, the developer behind it and the latest version.

## Installing and Using Apps

With each install an isolated copy of the app is installed in the user’s personal cloud. Only the user who installed the app has access to it and all the data the app stores is stored in the user’s personal cloud. The developer of the app does not have any access to the app or the data.

Once an app is installed it will appear on the “Canvas”, the home screen of the personal cloud. To launch an app simply click on an app’s icon. Space will open a new browser tab where you can use the app.

## Viewing App Data

To view an app’s data click the three dots (…) next to an app’s icon to open the context menu. There you will see an option called “View Data”. A new dialog will open up showing an interface which you can use to browse the data. You can use the search field to search the records in the app’s database or switch to “Drive” to view the files your app stores.

## Updating Apps

Different from traditional web apps, Space apps don’t update automatically when the developer makes a change. You the user are always in control of when to update an app. 

If an update for an app is available you will see a small yellow circle next to the app’s icon on the Canvas. Clicking that circle or clicking “Update App” in the app’s context menu (…) will open a dialog showing the update’s release notes. From there you can install the update.

> ⚠️ Disclaimer: Updating apps is still a new feature and it could break your app.

## Managing Apps

To change the order of the apps on your Canvas just click on an app and drag to move it to a different position.

If you want to uninstall an app entirely, open the app’s context menu (…) and click “Settings”. Confirm that you want to delete the app and click “Delete”.

> ⚠️ Deleting an app cannot be undone and all its data is permanently lost.

## Schedules

Scheduled actions allow an app to perform certain tasks on a specific interval. These tasks can be anything the developer builds into their app, from a cleanup job to automated data aggregation or revalidation.

Developers have to purposely enable and setup a scheduled action. When they do, they can choose a default interval which the action will run on. After installing an app, its scheduled actions are automatically enabled and set to run on this default interval specified by the dev. However, as a user, you can change the interval or disable an action from running at any point.

### Managing Schedules

To view and manage the scheduled actions of an app, open the app’s settings by clicking on the 3 dots (…) next to an app’s icon on the Canvas, then click "Settings" and then switch to the “Schedules” tab. If the app doesn’t have any scheduled actions, the tab won’t be there.

In the “Schedules” tab you will see a list of all the scheduled actions belonging to the app, whether or not they are enabled, what interval they are set to, and when they will run next. If an action is enabled you’ll see a “Configure” button which can be used to change the interval:

### Changing a Schedule

To change a scheduled action’s interval, click the “Configure” button in the “Schedules” tab in the app’s Settings. You will be shown options to choose between different interval types ranging from minutes to months and anything in between.

When you select an interval, the UI will show you when the action would run next. Once you are happy, click “Save” to schedule the action on the new interval.
